# Common Linux Media Issues (Outline)

1. No sound
   - Check default sink/output device
   - Check mute state and volume
   - Verify PipeWire or PulseAudio services are running

2. Video does not play or only audio
   - Check for missing codecs (ffmpeg)
   - Try alternate players (mpv, vlc)

3. Stuttering or tearing
   - Check GPU drivers and acceleration
   - Verify compositor and vsync settings

Each section should be expanded with commands and expected outputs.
